### *A program to determine the degree of axonal cross-over.*

The program we designed will help users (clinicians, researchers, and electromyographers), perform geometric nerve conduction waveforms subtractions with ease.
The purpose was to interrogate the degree of nerve cross-over. Ranging from natural (Martin-Gruber Anastomosis) or artifical (Nerve Transfers) nerve cross-over applications.

 - Included is the standalone Plotable installations for Windows and MacOS.

 - Additionally, a web-based Plotable is also accessible for convinience.

 - The original code for the "Plotable", can be found in the Plotable Folder --> "Plotable.mlapp" (Open with MATLAB App Desinger).
