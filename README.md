### *A program to determine the degree of axonal cross-over.*

The program we designed will help users (clinicians, researchers, and electromyographers), perform geometric nerve conduction waveforms subtractions with ease.
The purpose was to interrogate the degree of nerve cross-over. Ranging from natural (Martin-Gruber Anastomosis) or artifical (Nerve Transfers) nerve cross-over applications.

***One can open the program one of three ways:***

#### A)	Have MATLAB 

>   **1)**	Install **Plotable.mlappinstall** as a MATLAB App under the “Apps” tab in MATLAB.<br/>
>   **2)**	Open the development version: **Plotable.mlapp** (*Development Folder*) 

#### B)	Do not have MATLAB

>   **3)**	Install Plotable as a standalone app in the provided installation folders for Windows and MacOS.

<br/>


The original code for the Plotable can be found in the - *Development Folder* --> **Plotable.mlapp**.<br/>
>Open with *MATLAB App Designer* and enter "code view".
